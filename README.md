# Sugary Spire UNHAM Decompilation
So THIS is the Fabled Sugary Spire

A Decompilation for the Sugary Spire UNHAM Mod (Cotton Update)

GameMaker Version Used: ```2023.8```

> [!NOTE]
> This is the No FMOD Build

## Current Progress
Game is very Playable

### Things I have Done:
- Organized the entire Project
- Added Enums for Player States, Enemy States, Confetti States, and even the Menus
- Removed duplicated room code
- Playtested all levels (and variants) with all characters, and some commands

## Issues
- rousrDissounance extension is not working
- that's kinda it

### Thanks to
- zyledev, for his Playtest 3.2 Decompilation, which I have used as a base for organization
- The Sugary Spire Developers, for making Sugary Spire
- The UNHAM Mod Developers, for adding new improvements and features to Sugary Spire
